        <p>This bar chart displays which key each top track is in. 
            The options are C# (C sharp), G, G#, F, B, D, A, F#, E, A#, and D#. 
            There is somewhat of a linear distribution here. C# was the most popular key of top Spotify songs in 2023 (12.54%), 
            and D# was the least popular key of top Spotify tracks of 2023. C# is associated with despair, wailing, and weeping. 
            So sad music was really popular among top Spotify tracks.</p>
