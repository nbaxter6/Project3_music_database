        <p>This bar chart shows how many times each top song appeared in a Spotify playlist. The obvious winner was Taylor Swift's "Cruel Summer" which appeared in about 8000 Spotify playlists. No other song came close to 8000. Each one of these top songs appeared in a lot of playlists. The top 10 song which appeared in the least number of Spotify playlists was "Seven" by Jung Kook. "Seven" appeared in 500 playlists.</p>
